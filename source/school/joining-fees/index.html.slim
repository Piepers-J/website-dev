        a href="mailto:rugbyschool@bbrfc-celtic.be"  (rugbyschool@bbrfc-celtic.be)

          shorts and a T-Shirt or jersey. Note that because we play on 
          a high tech artificial pitch only plastic studs may be used (no metal studs)

      h3 Medical Form

      p

        | This is partially filled out by yourself and the bottom left 
          of it is completed by your doctor who must sign and stamp the
          part he/she completes. The medical examination should cost 
          you less than 30â‚¬ and take 5-10 minutes maximum!
  
      p

        | Once you have the completed medical form please send us a good 
          scanned copy by email. We will get you a license. The license 
          entitles you to FBRB insurance AND authorizes you to play in 
          all FBRB sanctioned matches.
