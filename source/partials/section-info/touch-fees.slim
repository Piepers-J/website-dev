    p

      | We have a strict policy regarding the fee payment. No player
        is <strong>to play or be registered</strong> until the fee has
        been paid. The latter is considered outstanding if not settled
        by the end of April. After that, a &euro;10 increase will
        be applied.

    p

      | The membership period is from 1st June to the end of May.

    p

      ' Payment plans are always an option, so please contact

      a href="mailto:treasurer@bbrfc-celtic.be" our treasurer

      |  if you would like one.

    p

      | VUB students who wish to only train with us can do so for
        free, without filling in any forms, provided they are insured
        by the VUB. To participate in tournaments, the normal
        procedure applies.
