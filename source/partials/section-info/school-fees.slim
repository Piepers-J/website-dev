  .panel-body
    p

      | We have a strict policy regarding the fee payment. No player
        is <strong>to play or be registered</strong> until the fee has
        been paid. The latter is considered outstanding if not settled
        by the end of September. After that, a &euro;10 increase will
        be applied.

    p

      ' Payment plans are always an option, so please contact

      a href="mailto:treasurer@bbrfc-celtic.be" our treasurer

      |  if you would like one.
