      | Payment policy!
  .panel-body
    p

      | We have a strict policy regarding the fee payment. No player
        is <strong>to play or be registered</strong> until the fee has
        been paid. The latter is considered outstanding if not settled
        by the end of September or 30 days after having joined. After
        that, a &euro;10 increase will be applied.

    p

      ' Payment plans are always an option, so please contact

      a href="mailto:treasurer@bbrfc-celtic.be" our treasurer

      |  if you would like one.

    p

      | VUB students who wish to only train with us can do so for
        free, without filling in any forms, provided they are insured
        by the VUB. To play matches, the normal procedure applies.
